# Clustering Social Media Tweets
Clustering the dataset based on the text/words to show different emotions like depression, happiness, neutral,  Ads and promotions etc. Techniques used include probability, clustering, text-analysis and time series analysis

## Business Questions

Thomas:
- **Text Mining (2-3 BQs):** Apply text mining techniques to extract useful information and discover semantic information hidden in texts. You may want to add an additional dataset relevant to your topic to the project that can provide you access to the text database. Support your results with adequate visualizations.
	
	1. Visualizing the frequently used unique words
	2. Sentimental Trends of Tweets Visualized

Pratyush:
- **Clustering (2 BQs):** Use clustering techniques to cluster data and provide insightful results. demonstrate how you obtained the best number of clusters and complement your clustering results with appropriate plots.

	1. Demonstrate using visualize function to determine the number of clusters. (Visualize the results)
	2. Cluster the tweets based on different sentiments. (Visualize the results)

Yang:
- **Time Series Analysis (2 BQs):** to understand how the past influences the future, determine seasonal variance, trends, and future forecast.

	1. Using the extracted day, determine seasonal variance in number of tweets. (Visualize the results)
	2. Extract different days of the week from the date column and determine the sentiments related to the day. Make trends based on day of the week and sentiments. (Visualize the results)

Pratyush:
- **Probability (2-3 BQs):** could include probability distribution calculator, conditional probability, distribution functions, joint distribution, distribution fitting, correlation analysis, or relevant ideas. Feel free to use data visualization to support your answers.

	1. Calculate the probability that each of the sentiments show up on a particular day?
	2. pmf, cdf table with the dates ( probability of a tweet being posted before a particular date)

## Professor's Notes for Time series - Integrate into Probability
- RQ analysis: make some changes on embedding.dim,time.lag, radius and write your own interpretations.
- graphs from lab1
- complexity and permutation - Inclusing our Interpretation of them
