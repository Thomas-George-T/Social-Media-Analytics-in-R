# Clustering Social Media Tweets
Clustering the dataset based on the text/words to show different emotions like depression, happiness, neutral,  Ads and promotions etc. Techniques used include probability, clustering, text-analysis and time series analysis

## Business Questions

Thomas:
- **Text Mining (2-3 BQs):** Apply text mining techniques to extract useful information and discover semantic information hidden in texts. You may want to add an additional dataset relevant to your topic to the project that can provide you access to the text database. Support your results with adequate visualizations.
	
	1. Remove stop words and try to visualize the remaining words. (Visualize the results)
	2. Extract different emotions from the tweets. (Visualize the results)
	3. Extract different months from the date column and determine the sentiments related to the month.

Pratyush:
- **Clustering (2 BQs):** Use clustering techniques to cluster data and provide insightful results. demonstrate how you obtained the best number of clusters and complement your clustering results with appropriate plots.

	1. Demonstrate using visualize function to determine the number of clusters. (Visualize the results)
	2. Cluster the tweets based on different sentiments. (Visualize the results)

Yang:
- **Time Series Analysis (2 BQs):** to understand how the past influences the future, determine seasonal variance, trends, and future forecast.

	1. Using the extracted month, determine seasonal variance in number of tweets. (Visualize the results)
	2. Make trends based on months and sentiments. (Visualize the results)
	3. Using past data, can we predict the sentiments and number of tweets in the future.

Pratyush:
- **Probability (2-3 BQs):** could include probability distribution calculator, conditional probability, distribution functions, joint distribution, distribution fitting, correlation analysis, or relevant ideas. Feel free to use data visualization to support your answers.

	1. Correlation analysis between users and months/sentiments.
	2. distribution function that users tweet about certain sentiment during certain months of the year.

## Professor's Notes for Time series
- RQ analysis: make some changes on embedding.dim,time.lag, radius and write your own interpretations.
- graphs from lab1
- complexity and permutation - Inclusing our Interpretation of them
